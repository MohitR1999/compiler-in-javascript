# How to contribute?
Well, right now it is a pretty small project in its very early stage of development, but if you want to contribute, you can open an issue and I could look into it. 

There are a few things you could help with:
- Improve the documentation: Very much needed.
- Improve the existing code: I am writing the code with my existing knowledge of javascript, so experienced devs are most welcome to help.

What you should not do:
- Do not open a pull request without opening an issue first. I will not accept any pull requests without an issue.
- Please don't open spammy PRs. They will be marked as invalid.
- Please refrain from adding new features. I'm making this project for my own learning and I want to build it step by step on my own to improve my skills.

Happy hacking :)
